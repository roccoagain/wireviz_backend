# WireViz Backend

This is the backend for WireViz, which was made for HackCU 11. WireViz allows you to draw a circuit on an ipad and get its simulation plots with the tap of a button. This backend recieves a netlist, runs ngspice to simulate it, and plots the output before returning it to the ipad client. The netlist is generated by the ipad with an openai api call, which can eventually be done server side too.
