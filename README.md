# WireViz Backend

This is the backend for WireViz, which was made for HackCU 11. WireViz allows you to draw a circuit on an iPad and get its simulation plots with the tap of a button. This backend recieves a netlist, runs ngspice to simulate it, and plots the output before returning it to the iPad client.
